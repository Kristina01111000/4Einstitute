 "Four Element Institute”.  This summer I intend to initiate a clinical study for Early Alzheimer’s. I’m planning on 10-40 people volunteering. They will not be patients of mine;  but will be going through the Institute. 
No charges involved, no adjustments or nutrition involved. They will be receiving a set of special cranial exercises and a journal. They’ll be getting Cognitive Impairment Testing pre and post; They will come to my office and receive videos for exercising protocol. As a group they will come regularly for check-ins.

It’s going to be a simple site with an explanation of the treatment and info to contact it they want to join.
