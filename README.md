Using astra theme

not a very complicated site, 
not collecting medical data

This site is going to be for giving information to people, not storing peoples info correct? CORRECT
Will be an informational site, collect emails from people, not a really in depth site, info page, about page, contact us page
 "Four Element Institute”.  This summer I intend to initiate a clinical study for Early Alzheimer’s. I’m planning on 10-40 people volunteering. They will not be patients of mine;  but will be going through the Institute. 
No charges involved, no adjustments or nutrition involved. They will be receiving a set of special cranial exercises and a journal. They’ll be getting Cognitive Impairment Testing pre and post; They will come to my office and receive videos for exercising protocol. As a group they will come regularly for check-ins.

It’s going to be a simple site with an explanation of the treatment and info to contact it they want to join.  


- need new email for contact page, it does to admin email, i don;t want that 



Need a different email for four element institute contact form to go to - > send them to  hwalsdorf@e it will be something@fourelementinstitute.org will automatically be forwarded to his email contact@fourelementinstitute.org set that up
Is the new font good? Look at a more modern sans serif type font, still make sure that the I has a top and bottom line. Remember name of current one so we can go back if we like it more, 

- waiting on logo
- Set up contact page so it works -> need institute data for send in blue, -> they need it so spammers don't use their service
- Add his picture to about us page -> copy from univchir site?
- add sendinblue to set up the contact page -> need business info for it 


- linked in sidebar, removed click here, it looked unprofessional compared to the website, do you want a link to join us in the sidebar?
- is early alzheimers study a good title for the project page?


Think of better title/picture for title
Set up contact page so it works
Put resources for everyone onto the resource page (from projects)
Look at spacing on sidebar to see if it can be better
In form capitalize the academic institution
For about us copy about dr walsdorf from the other sites
Should his part be on the about us page or a separate page, look at other medical sites to see how they handle it, he’s leaning to another page, put like 4 paragraphs about him
Make another page for about him, link to it from the about us page
