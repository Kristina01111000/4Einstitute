drws website

Using astra theme

not a very complicated site, 
not collecting medical data

- giving information to people
- not storing peoples info 
- informational site only

Need a different email for four element institute contact form to go to - > send them to  hwalsdorf@e it will be something@fourelementinstitute.org will automatically be forwarded to his email contact@fourelementinstitute.org set that up

- check the score card page, is updated to be like the on on gh?
- need to add him as admin in analytics once it goes through -> do this next week on thursday before call
- he can login to the site now, was having an issue before.  uses his gmail email for it
- double check the score card page


find a new security plugin, or see if the security plugin works now w/o causing issues for login -> it is still an issue, look at other plugins or find another way to login
Is he still using this site? should he talk to the publicist about this?

don't link to the patreon from this site
get a new security plugin

- need to look at all the pages to see if they are updated to current standards


- need to check any links to 30 day challenge, change to tabulator

- ask about email 


- He wants a new page for each project, he will write something and send it to me- > not focusing on that right now

- look at more images for the site, some that look more professional
