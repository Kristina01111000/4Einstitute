drws website

Using astra theme

not a very complicated site, 
not collecting medical data

- giving information to people
- not storing peoples info 
- informational site only

Need a different email for four element institute contact form to go to - > send them to  hwalsdorf@e it will be something@fourelementinstitute.org will automatically be forwarded to his email contact@fourelementinstitute.org set that up

- need to add him as admin in analytics once it goes through -> do this next week on thursday before call
- he can login to the site now, was having an issue before.  uses his gmail email for it



find a new security plugin, or see if the security plugin works now w/o causing issues for login -> it is still an issue, look at other plugins or find another way to login

- need to look at all the pages to see if they are updated to current standards
- ask about email 

- He wants a new page for each project, he will write something and send it to me- > not focusing on that right now
- look at more images for the site, some that look more professional
- - the images we have are ok for now, he probably will want something different
